 3. make sure ur CSV file is named "input.csv"
 4. run the program and wait (takes awhile cuz python yk)


 NOTE: you can download ur data straight from tiktok as a JSON or TXT file, I lowk downloaded mine as a TXT and used chat gpt to format it into CSV (yes yes throw tomatoes)  
maybe in the future ill make it so you can directly upload the json file but yea
