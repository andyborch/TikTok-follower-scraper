HOW TO USE
--------------
1. Download your data from TikTok as a TXT NOT JSON (im dumb with JSON )      (im also not explaining allat js look it up sry)
2. locate the file "followers.txt"
3.  Make sure ur  Python File and Followers.txt file are in the same directory
4. Run the program and wait (takes awhile cuz python yk)

it should return a csv file called output.csv in the same directory, just open it in sheets or docs and sort by largest to smallest
